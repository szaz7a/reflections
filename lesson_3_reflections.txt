When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It's a good way to backup stuff. Using several computers. Collaborating.
    Sharing.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Generally I want to be in control of the project and decide when
	to do such actions. Also I might not be the only one updating remote,
	so I don't want to automatically add other people's updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking you can do in GitHub to create a clone for you. Cloning allows you
	to clone a repository to your own computer and branches allows working on
	different versions of a project more easily.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    At least it makes comparing your recent changes easier to the last known
	remote master with commands like diff and log.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Perhaps just using email or Google Docs. It would definately be
    harder to know what is the main version (master) and what kind
    of things (branches) are people working on.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Separate branches are for more experimental stuff, when you are collaborating
	with others, when you want to ensure that master stays healthy and when creating
	different versions of the product.
