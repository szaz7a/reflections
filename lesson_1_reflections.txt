How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it much easier than checking it just by comparing files by using eyes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It must make it more helpful to find bugs and to even understand the code and your coding process. I'm sure it's helpful.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually choosing allows better control. Automatic can do do more
    stupid stuff. Main problem with manual is that user has the
    responsibility to save at logical times.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think that in programming it's more typical to work
    with several very much related files than with typical
    office programs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the overview of all commits. git diff shows the
    difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With version control system it's easier to go back, so that's true,
    it makes it less risky to try something new.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'd like to use it in my own projects eventuallu.
